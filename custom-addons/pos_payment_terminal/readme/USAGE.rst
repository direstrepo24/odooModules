In the frontend of the POS, when you select a payment method that has a payment mode with *Use a Payment Terminal* set to *OCA Payment Terminal*, you will have an additionnal *Send* button: if you click on that button, the amount, the currency and the payment mode will be sent to the POSbox/IoTBox/pywebdriver.
